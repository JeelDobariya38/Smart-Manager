# Problem Statement

In today's tech-driven world, the need to securely store sensitive data, including account and authentication information, on a local computer is essential to enhance data privacy and security.

# Smart Manager Requirements

Smart Manager is designed to meet the following system requirements:

1. **Data Storage:** The system should provide secure local data storage.

2. **Security:** Data stored must be well-protected to prevent unauthorized access.

3. **Account-Specific Data:** The system should allow users to organize data on an account-specific basis, ensuring efficient data management.

4. **Authentication System:** A robust authentication system is essential to control access and enhance overall security.

5. **Data Persistence:** The system should support storing and retrieving data between different sessions, ensuring data is stored persistently, such as in files rather than in memory variables.

6. **Scalability and Reliability:** The system should be designed to be scalable, reliable, and flexible to handle growing data requirements.

7. **License:** The project must be licensed under the MIT License.
