# Deployment Guidelines

To deploy the Smart Manager Application, follow these step-by-step guidelines:

## Testing Application

Before deploying, thoroughly test the application both locally and through automated testing. Manual testing can also help ensure a robust deployment.

## Drafting Release

Draft a release on the GitHub repository, adhering to the guidelines outlined in [Version Guidelines](Version_Guidelines.md). This ensures consistency and clarity in versioning.

## Asset Uploading

After drafting a release, proceed to create and upload assets. Follow these guidelines:

- Assets should be named using the pattern `smart-manager.${release.tag.name}.python.zip`.
- The .zip file must include essential files such as `LICENSE` and `README`, along with other files required for the application to run.
- Ensure that the .zip file directly contains its content rather than being nested within a folder named "smart_manager."

## Checking for Errors

Before publishing the release, meticulously check for any human errors. If identified, address them promptly to avoid issues in the production environment.

## Publishing

Once all checks are completed, publish the release to make it available in a real production environment.

## Monitoring

With the release in production, monitor for any errors. This includes checking for issues in the deployment process or within the application source code itself.

These guidelines are designed to ensure a smooth and error-free deployment process. Following each step diligently contributes to a successful release and a stable production environment.
