        <h2>Reporting Issues</h2>

        <p>If you come across any issues or have suggestions for improvement, kindly <a href="https://github.com/JeelDobariya38/Smart-Manager/issues">create an issue</a> on GitHub. Ensure to provide meticulous information about the problem and steps to reproduce it.</p>

        <h2>Code Style</h2>

        <p>Maintain consistency with the code style employed in the project, including uniform indentation and formatting. When in doubt, refer to the existing codebase for guidance.</p>

        <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>

        <p>Please be mindful that this project adheres to a <a href="CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">Code of Conduct</a>. By participating, you agree to uphold these principles.</p>

        <h2>Running the Smart Manager App Locally</h2>

        <p>To run the Smart Manager app on your local environment, employ the provided Python script. Ensure Python is installed and that you are in the repository's root directory, then execute:</p>

        <pre class="lang-py"><code>python src/main.py</code></pre>

        <h2>Contributing Code</h2>

        <p>For code contributions, adhere to the coding conventions and encompass relevant tests.</p>

        <h3>Example Code</h3>

        <p>Here is an example Python script. Feel free to provide your feedback or contribute to enhance the repository's style:</p>

        <pre class="lang-py"><code>def greet(name: str) -> None:
    message = f"Hello, {name}!"
    print(message)

def calculate_sum(a: int | float, b: int | float) -> int | float:
    result = a + b
    return result

if __name__ == "__main__":
    user_name = input("Enter your name: ")
    greet(user_name)

    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
    num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

    total = calculate_sum(num1, num2)
    print(f"The sum is: {total}")
        </code></pre>

        <p><strong>Notable Code Elements for Reference</strong></p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Indentation:</strong> Consistently use 4 spaces for indentation, a widely accepted convention in Python, to maintain uniformity.</li>
            <li><strong>Whitespace:</strong> Ensure consistency in spacing around operators and after commas, as observed in the existing codebase.</li>
            <li><strong>Imports:</strong> Organize imports and follow the standard Python style. Group third-party imports at the top, preceded by a blank line, followed by built-in module imports.</li>
            <li><strong>Function and Method Naming:</strong> Keep function and method names in lowercase with words separated by underscores (<code>snake_case</code>), in adherence to Python's recommended convention.</li>
            <li><strong>Use of Type Hints:</strong> Continue using type hints for function arguments and return types to enhance code clarity and maintain readability.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Remember, these guidelines are flexible, with the primary emphasis on maintaining consistency within the codebase.</p>
